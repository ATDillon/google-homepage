# google-homepage

Project from The Odin Project's curriculum: ("https://www.theodinproject.com/")


This is a nonfunctional lookalike of Google's homepage, made to practice putting together CSS and HTML to create a basic webpage. Going through this project I've learned the basics of CSS grid and flexbox, as well as how to structure webpage with HTML.
